description: "Ptychography through Differentiable Programming\nThe aim of this project\
  \ is to write the forward problem: aka writing the microscope data generation, both\
  \ for electron and optical microscopes in JAX so that it's end to end differentiable\
  \ and using this differentiability to run modern optimizers such as Adam and Adagrad\
  \ to solve for the inverse problem - which is ptychography in our case."
